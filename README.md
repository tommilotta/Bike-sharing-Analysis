# Analysis of the bike-sharing systems (BSS) of New York, Chicago and Boston
The datasets taken in consideration here are related to the month of April of 2019.

The approach used is first to analyze the BSS as networks with centrality measures like PageRank, then to cluster the bike-stations with machine learning techniques.

All of this analysis aims to find some aspects that may be improved to get more people to use this type of environmental- and human-friendly transportation mode.
